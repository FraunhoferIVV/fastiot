Tutorial Part 3: Config management
**********************************

The configuration of a FastIoT project is divided in three parts:

1. :file:`configure.py` for the overall project setup.
2. :file:`manifest.yaml` in the service’s directory to specifically configure a single service.
3. Deployments in the directory :file:`deployments` to configure the roll out of the software.
